<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>My name is Megan Van Rafelghem. I am an artist, a volleyball player, a lover of science, and a pun enthusiast. </p>

  <h2>Puns</h2>
  <p> My goal in life is to fill the world with laughter and happiness. I believe I can achieve this through dispersing my extensive knowledge of word play and punnery. I started my project at a young age, enlightening my peers every week or so, by posting pictures on instagram with captions with puns in them. I learned over time that this was not an extensive enough audience. I want to develop an app that connects punners throughout the world. The app will allow users to interact with each other and help one another to come up with original and unique puns, while also providing them with a search engine that they can use in order to find the most well known or popular puns that have to do with their topic. For now, the app is not yet developed so I will leave you with a few puns to satiate your humorous souls. </p>
